    <p>
        This coming school year, another student organization is launching a program to support conservation efforts to
        save dugongs (manatees) in Kalibo, Aklan. To help implement the program, the organization is also requesting
        students of UP Diliman to contribute to help fund the program.

        the tokens you received today either to the (A) conservation and restoration of seagrass, (B) conservation and
        protect the dugong (manatees).
