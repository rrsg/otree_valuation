    <p>
        This coming school year, another student organization is launching a program to support conservation efforts to
        save dugongs (manatees) in Kalibo, Aklan. To help implement the program, the organization is also requesting
        students of UP Diliman to contribute to help fund the program.
    </p>

    <p>
        Since both programs are accepting donations, you have the opportunity to contribute a portion, all, or none of
        the tokens you received today either to the (a) conservation and restoration of seagrass, (b) conservation and
        protect the dugong (manatees).

    </p>

    {% formfield player.contributionVJ1 label="[VJ.1] Of the Php 100.00, how much are you willing to contribute to the seagrass program?" %}
    {% formfield player.contributionVJ2 label="[VJ.2] Of the Php 100.00, how much are you willing to contribute to the dugong program?" %}

    <p>
        Take note that the sum of both amounts should be less than or equal to Php 100.00.
